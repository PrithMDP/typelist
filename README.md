# TypeList

This is an attempt to implement a comile time `typelist` which essentially a set that contains different types at compile time. 

Inspiration: http://www.drdobbs.com/generic-programmingtypelists-and-applica/184403813

## Operations

Currently `intersection` and `union` are supported by using the templated structs `intersection` and `combiner` respectively.

Would like to add `addition`, `subtraction` and other set operations as well.
